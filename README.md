# MQuicker
<p>Stop clicking through endless links to see if there is a new chapter available. This Python script lets you <a href="README.md#function-directory">list all your favorite mangas</a> and then checks each one's latest chapter against your most recently read chapter. Currently <a href="README.md#Codes">supports web comics from</a> Zero and Leviatan Scans, LHTranslation, Asura Scans, Isekais Scans, and more.</p>

When <a href="https://jacobk233811.github.io/MQuicker">setting up for yourself</a>, follow the linked steps for your OS. All Windows Users should go through Two-Step Install, regardless of having Python. Mac Users should go through the Two-Step Install if they do not have Python and One-Step Install if they do. To join our Discord community, <a href="https://discord.gg/f7r8Emws8G">use this link</a>. Anyone there will happily help you with installation or discuss manga with you.

Windows Users who use the Two-Step Powershell Install can run in one click! Two-Step Install for Mac is available and has similar functionality. After using Two-Step or One-Step Install, users can open Terminal and run <em>sh launch.sh</em> to start the program. If this does not work, try <em>sh $HOME/launch.sh</em> . <b>Choose Show All to see it work and Primer to customize for yourself on first use.</b>

  <li>yts = yet to start</li>

<h3>Tier - My personal rankings of the "starter pack" manga as seen in <a href="tier.txt">tier.txt</a>. Intended to help selective new readers choose only the best. Found as (#) in manga names.</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The Top Tier reserved for my favorites.</li>
  <li>The Middle Tier for all the manga I really liked.</li>
  <li>The Bottom Tier holds manga that I liked some parts and not others. </li>
 </ol>
 Note: I read and enjoyed all manga within the initial list.txt file so don't take this to mean Tier 2 or 3 are low quality.
 
<h3> Categories - My personal categories for the "starter pack" manga as seen in <a href="categories.txt">categories.txt</a>. Intended to help readers identify preferences. Found as [Abcd] in manga names.</h3>
<ol>
  <li>System Leveling - Worlds where there exists a system of some sort that allows "players" or "hunters" to level up and become physically stronger.</li>
  <li>Culivator Reincarnation - The main character reincarnated and uses his knowledge to cultivate faster. More fantastical/magical than below.</li>
  <li>Martial Reincarnation - The main character reincarnated and uses his knowledge to train faster. More realistic than above.</li>
